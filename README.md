Dynamic Array Operations Exercise

This repository contains a C++ program that demonstrates dynamic array operations. The program allows the user to create a dynamic array, initialize it with a value, and display its contents.

    create_array: This function creates a new integer array of a given size and returns a pointer to it.
    initilalize_arr: This function initializes a given integer array with a given value.
    display: This function displays the contents of a given integer array.
